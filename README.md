Hey there! 
So you're checking out the markdown, huh? I'll take that as a compliment.

It's just an SVG with some computer word salad thrown in... 

but yeah, 

    If you're here for the easter egg hint,
    here you go 
          +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
          Found the marker? Ace.
          1.) Instruction 
          `sed -n 'n;p'` // next-line, printed

          2.) Wisdom
          "Put meaning before motion.
          Let **words** guide you.
          Think **in** systems, not fragments.
          Sometimes **one** idea is enough.
          A straight **line.**
          
          There are **No** shortcuts.
          **spaces** deceive**.**
          Only what can **survive** matters.
          Then **Hash** what **remains.**"
          ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
